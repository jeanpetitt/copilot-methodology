\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Research Design}
This study employs a quantitative research design to investigate the potential of leveraging the GPT model for semantic table annotation. The study is situated within the domains of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Data Annotation, and Semantic Web. The primary objective is to statistically analyze the performance of the GPT model in enhancing semantic table annotation by assessing its precision, recall, and F1-score.

\subsection{Participants}
The study is designed around experimental conditions without the involvement of human subjects; thus, the participants are essentially the experimental setups themselves. The experiments aim to rigorously test hypotheses regarding the semantic annotation capabilities of the GPT model.

\subsection{Tools and Materials}
The study utilizes computational tools for experimentation and data analysis. Specifically, the following elements are involved:

\begin{itemize}
    \item GPT Model: Employed for the purpose of annotating table semantics.
    \item Evaluation Metrics: The study uses standard metrics of precision, recall, and F1-score to quantify the performance of the model in semantic annotation tasks.
    \item Dataset: The SuperSemTab2024 dataset is selected for experimentation due to its comprehensive and robust tabular content, which is ideal for semantic annotation challenges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Procedures}
Although no specific procedure was defined in advance, the experimental process involved standard practices of model evaluation in the domain of semantic annotation. The general process includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dataset Preparation: The SuperSemTab2024 dataset is pre-processed and split into training and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
    \item Model Training: The GPT model is trained on the prepared dataset, optimizing parameters to enhance its semantic understanding capabilities.
    \item Model Testing: The trained model is tested on the test dataset, where its performance is measured using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
    \item Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing is conducted to understand whether the improvements in model performance are statistically significant.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Analysis}
The results from the model’s performance metrics are statistically analyzed. The main focus is to perform hypothesis testing to determine the model’s effectiveness in improving the semantic annotation process. The precision, recall, and F1-score metrics obtained are analyzed to draw meaningful conclusions about the model’s capabilities in semantic annotation within the stipulated experimental settings.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
As the research does not involve human participants, ethical considerations directly impacting individuals are minimal. However, due care is taken to ensure that data privacy and integrity are maintained, especially in the handling of the SuperSemTab2024 dataset, adhering to best practices in data management and machine learning experimentation.

In conclusion, this methodological framework serves to systematically explore the capabilities of the GPT model in semantic table annotation, providing insights into its potential improvements in information retrieval tasks.

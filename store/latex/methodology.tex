\section{Methodology}

This study addresses the research question: "How can the GPT model be leveraged for semantic table annotation?" The study sits at the intersection of several domains, including Natural Language Processing, Semantic Web, Machine Learning, and Data Annotation. Given the exploratory nature of the research question, a mixed-methods approach is adopted, integrating both qualitative and quantitative techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis.

\subsection{Research Design}

The research design comprises two main components: a survey and semi-structured interviews. This approach allows for the triangulation of data to enhance the reliability and validity of the findings. 

\subsection{Participants}

The participants of the study are researchers and AI experts with diverse backgrounds in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Semantic Web, and Data Annotation. This demographic was chosen to ensure the collected data is rich with expert insight and reflective of current industry practices and theoretical knowledge.

\subsection{Tools and Instruments}

The study employs two primary tools for data collection:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Survey:} The survey was designed to quantify the familiarity and experiences of participants with semantic table annotation and their perspectives on utilizing GPT models for this purpose. The survey consisted of a combination of closed and open-ended questions, allowing for both standard statistical analysis and more nuanced qualitative insights.
  \item \textbf{Interviews:} Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of survey participants to delve deeper into the insights gathered from the survey. The interviews provided an opportunity to explore participants’ thoughts in more detail, uncovering underlying motivations and barriers in the adoption of GPT models for this task.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Collection Procedures}

The data collection process consisted of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Survey Dissemination} - The survey was distributed electronically via email to a targeted list of participants, identified through professional networks and forums related to Natural Language Processing and Semantic Web research.
  \item \textbf{Interview Execution} - Following the survey, interviews were scheduled with selected participants who consented to participate in the second phase of the study. Interviews were conducted via video conferencing platforms to accommodate participant availability and geographic diversity. Each interview lasted approximately 30-45 minutes and was recorded with the consent of the participants for further analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Analysis}

\textbf{Quantitative Data:} The responses from the survey were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods to identify patterns in participants’ experiences and perceptions. Statistical software was utilized for this purpose to ensure precision in data interpretation.

\textbf{Qualitative Data:} The transcripts from the interviews were coded thematically. An inductive approach was used to identify emergent themes, allowing for a deeper understanding of the qualitative data. NVivo software assisted in managing and organizing the data, facilitating the identification of recurring patterns and insights.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}

Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Participants were informed of their rights and provided with informed consent forms prior to their participation. Confidentiality and anonymity were assured, with data being stored securely and used solely for the purposes of this research.

This methodology is designed to effectively address the research objectives, contributing both empirical data and theoretical insights to the field of semantic table annotation through the innovative application of GPT models.
